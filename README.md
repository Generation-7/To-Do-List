### What is To Do List? 

<P>The meaning is very simple. To Do List is a list of tasks and activities that must be done.</P>

### Benefits of using To Do List:
<p>
  
One of the most important reasons why you should use a To Do List is that it helps keep your work and plans in a clear and orderly framework. When you write down all the things that need to be done in one list, they seem more manageable. And when you have an overall view of what needs to be done and what you've done so far, not only does your mind stay focused, but it also opens up more mental space in your mind to handle creative work.
  When you finish a task, you cross it off. This gives you a sense of progress and accomplishment, which is exactly what you don't feel if you're in a hurry to get things done and fall behind. And getting this feeling of success increases your motivation to progress and move forward.
